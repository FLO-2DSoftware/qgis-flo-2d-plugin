FLO-2D Toolbar
==============

This section will cover the FLO-2D Toolbar from left to right.  The FLO-2D Toolbar contains many tools to setup, import, and export FLO-2D Data files in QGIS.

**Important Note:  If the Toolbar is missing, make sure the FLO-2D Plugin checkbox is checked in the Plugin Manager.**
