Import a Geo Package
=====================

When the FLO-2D Plugin is updated, the Geo Package structure changes. The
project can no longer be opened in the standard method described in the
previous section.

To Update a Geo Package:
--------------------------

1. Set up a new project (see `FLO-2D Plugin Settings <Flo-2D%20Settings.html>`__). This will build
   the new Geo Database.


2. Select the
   Import from Geo Package button from the FLO-2D Toolbar.

3. Navigate to the location of the Geo Package and click Open. This will
   import the old data into the new format.

   messages.
