Profile Tool
=============

The profile tool is primarily used to review the channel profile but can also be used to review table data for specific features.

Raster Profile
--------------

Create a Raster

1. Set up the raster in the Profile Tool widget.
   In this example, the grid elevation raster is used.
   To create a grid elevation raster, use the Saga-Rasterize tool.
   On the Main QGIS Menu, click Processing>Toolbox.

2. Enter the search term *Rasterize* in the Processing Toolbox search feature.
   Double click the Saga Rasterized tool.

3. Change the dialog box as shown below and click *Run*.
   Cell size is the grid element size.
   Fit = cells will ensure that the raster pixels are centered on the grid elements.
   Saga-Rasterize is a good raster generator for FLO-2D data because it builds a raster with hidden null data.
   QGIS has many raster generators, and they all work slightly differently.

The raster that is created is a temporary layer called *Rasterize*.
This layer should be saved to a permanent layer using the QGIS *Save As* feature.
This feature is found by right clicking the layer.

Plot a profile of a polyline on the raster.
-------------------------------------------

The profile tool works for Levee, Channel and Street polylines that are digitized in the user layers only.
This example will test it on a channel polyline.

1. Click the *Raster profile* radio button and set the raster.
   This example uses *Grid Elevation* raster.

2. Click *the FLO-2D Info Tool* and click on a channel
   segment.

3. Select the segment and the elevation profile along the segment line is plotted in the FLO-2D Plot area and the Raster data along the channel line is
   printed to the FLO-2D Table.
   Any data that can be rasterized can be plotted in this manner.
   The table can be copied to an Excel sheet and saved.
