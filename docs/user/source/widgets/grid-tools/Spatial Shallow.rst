Spatial Shallow n
=================

Overview
--------

A spatially variable shallow n-value enables the flow roughness to be depth integrated enable high n-values at shallow flow depths.
The value can also be globally assigned in the *FLO-2D Control and Tolerance Variables* window.
Polygons can be applied to select individual or groups of grid elements to supersede the global n-value as in the case for streets and parking lots.

Digitize or Copy Data
---------------------

1. Select the *Shallow-n Areas*
   layer and click edit.

2. Create or copy the polygons
   that represent the shallow roughness areas to the layer and save them.

Sample Data
-----------

1. Click the *Sampling Spatial Shallow-n Values*
   icon and then *OK* once the process is complete.

Troubleshooting
---------------

1. Create the shallow-n polygons
   if they are missing from the *Shallow-n Areas* layer.

2. If the Grid layer is empty,
   create a grid and try again.

3. If a Python error appears during the sampling process, the attribute table may be missing.
   Save and reload the project into QGIS and try again.
