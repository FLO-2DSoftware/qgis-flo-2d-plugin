Schematized Channel Editor
==========================

This editor widget is used to edit the control data and tabular data of the schematized channels.
It works on any schematized channel data including, imported data, imported RAS data and digitized data.
This data is written to the CHAN.DAT and CHANBANK.DAT files.

Initial Conditions
------------------

The global initial depth value can be set in the channel segment control data.
This is a single value that is assigned to every cell in the channel segment when the model starts.

Initial Water Surface Elevation
-------------------------------

The initial water surface elevation is used to set the variable initial conditions.
The values are assigned to the first and last element in a segment and interpolated to each cell in the channel at runtime.
