Green-Ampt Infiltration Calculator
-------------------------------------

To use the Green-Ampt calculator, the user must prepare soil and landuse shapefiles.
The soils data is acquired from the United States Department of Agriculture Web Soil Survey (USDA, 2017).
The data is organized by soil group.
The land use data can be acquired from various sources but is generally available from the United States Geological Survey Land Cover website (USGS,
2017).
The land use data can account for vegetative cover and impervious cover.

1. Prepare the data into  
   shapefiles using QGIS or import them into QGIS.

.. image:: ../../img/Infiltration-Editor/Infilt012.png

2. The infiltration  
   polygons need the attributes listed below.

.. image:: ../../img/Infiltration-Editor/Infilt013.png

3. To run the calculator,  
   click the Calculate Green-Ampt button.

.. image:: ../../img/Infiltration-Editor/Infilt014.png

4. Fill the form and  
   click OK.

5. The plugin will  
   assign spatially variable infiltration data to each cell using an intersection and weighted average.

6. When the infiltration  
   calculator is finished, the following message will appear.

3. The INFIL.DAT file  
   looks like this:

4. Where the infiltration  
   type is 2 = SCS infiltration.

5. The 85 is the uniform curve  
   number for each grid.

6. The 0.01 is the initial  
   abstraction.

Spatial Infiltration from User Layer
------------------------------------

Spatially variable floodplain infiltration is set by digitizing infiltration polygons or importing infiltration polygons.
Use the polygon editor to digitize spatially variable infiltration.
Create a polygon to represent an area of infiltration.

1. Select the Infiltration  
   Areas user layer.

2. Click the editor pencil and  
   snapping magnet button.

.. image:: ../../img/Infiltration-Editor/Infilt021.png

3. Create the polygons the  
   represent areas with the same curve number.

4. Fill the table for the  
   infiltration data.

.. image:: ../../img/Infiltration-Editor/Infilt022.png

5. The finished table has a  
   CN for every polygon.

6. Click the Save button to  
   save the attributes.

7. Click the pencil button  
   to close the editor.

Troubleshooting
---------------

1. Infiltration calculators all use intersection tools.
   This can cause problems if the shapefiles are not set up correctly.
   Specifically, land use and soils shapefiles that may have been converted from raster data.
   If errors persist, use “fix geometry”, “simplify”, and “dissolve” on the source shapefiles.
   These tools are part of the QGIS Processing Toolbox.
   They can also be corrected in ArcGIS if the datasets are very large.

2. Make sure the shapefiles completely cover the grid.
   If a grid element is outside the coverage of the infiltration, QGIS will show an error.

3. Make sure the shapefile fields have a correctly defined number type.
   The shapefiles that are supplied with the QGIS Lessons will help define the Field Variable Format such as string, whole number or decimal number.
