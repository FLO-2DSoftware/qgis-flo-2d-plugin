Green-Ampt Infiltration Calculator FCDMC Method
------------------------------------------------

To use the Flood Control District of Maricopa County (FCDMC) Green-Ampt calculator, the user must prepare soil,
landuse, and eff shapefiles.  The data is provided by the District.  See the FCDMC hydrology manual for a more detailed
discussion on modeling with the Green and Ampt method.

1. Prepare the soil data shapefile as seen in the following figure.

 - ROCKOUT is the percentage of rock outcrop coverage.  0 to 100
 - XKSAT is the hydraulic conductivity for the soil group. in/hr
 - Soil Depth is the limiting infiltration depth. Once the infiltration reaches this depth, it will turn off.  ft or m

.. image:: ../../img/Infiltration-Editor/infil001.png


2. Prepare the Landuse data shapefile as seen in the following figure.

 - Saturation is the initial saturation condition.  wet, dry, or normal
 - Initial Abstraction storage depth that must be reached before infiltration begins.  in or mm
 - Impervious area is the percentage of impermeability for a given polygon.  0 to 100
 - Vegetative cover is not used by FCDMC.

.. image:: ../../img/Infiltration-Editor/infil002.png


3. Prepare the EFF data shapefile as seen in the following figure.

 - Eff is the percent effectiveness of the impervious space.  It pertains more to HEC-1 calculations but can also be
   applied as an additional control or adjustment for a 2D grid.  If an EFF polygon is present, the calculator will
   multiply the RTIMP grid * the EFF to determine a final RTIMP.  0 to 100

.. image:: ../../img/Infiltration-Editor/infil003.png


4. To run the calculator,
   click the Calculate Green-Ampt button.

.. image:: ../../img/Infiltration-Editor/Infilt014.png


5. Fill the form and
   click OK.

.. image:: ../../img/Infiltration-Editor/Infilt015.png


6. The calculator uses the following
   methods for the FCDMC Green-Ampt Infiltration.


**Hydraulic Conductivity** (XKSAT) is calculated by an intersection between the soil polygons and the grid with
a log weighted average calculation.

.. image:: ../../img/Infiltration-Editor/infil004.png


**Capillary suction** (PSIF) is derived from a lookup table in the FCDMC Hydrology Manual Composite Values of PSIF
and DTHETA as a Function of XKSAT.

.. image:: ../../img/Infiltration-Editor/infil005.png


**Soil moisture deficit** (DTHETA) is the volumetric measurement of the soil moisture storage capacity.  It is also
derived from a FCDMC table for Composite Values of PSIF and DTHETA as a function of XKSAT.  The following lookup
lookup tables are applied based on the Initial Saturation Condition.

.. image:: ../../img/Infiltration-Editor/infil007.png


**Initial abstraction** (IA) is the intersection between the Landuse polygons and the grid with an area weighted
average calculation.

.. image:: ../../img/Infiltration-Editor/infil008.png


**Impervious** - (RTIMP) is the percent impervious for the grid element.  This calculation
is taken from an area weighted average of the RTIMPmax and the grid element.

**RTIMPmax** - Intersection(Landuse, Soil) makes a temporary polygon
layer of the maximum of the parts from RTIMPlu and RockOut.

**RTIMPgrid** - Intersection(RTIMPmax, Grid)
calculates the area weighted average RTIMP for each grid element.

.. image:: ../../img/Infiltration-Editor/infil009.png

**RTIMPfinal** - Intersection(EFFareas, Grid)
samples the EFFareas * 0.01 * RTIMPgrid for any grid centroid within an EFF polygon.

7. When the infiltration
   calculator is finished, the following message will appear.

Troubleshooting
---------------

1. Infiltration calculators all use intersection tools.
   This can cause problems if the shapefiles are not set up correctly.
   Specifically, land use and soils shapefiles that may have been converted from raster data.
   If errors persist, try “fix geometry”, “simplify”, and “dissolve” on the source shapefiles.
   These tools are part of the QGIS Processing Toolbox.
   They can also be corrected in ArcGIS if the datasets are very large.

2. Make sure the shapefiles completely cover the grid.
   If a grid element is outside the coverage of the infiltration, QGIS will show an error.

3. Make sure the shapefile fields have a correctly defined number type.
   The shapefiles that are supplied with the QGIS Lessons will help define the Field Variable Format such as string,
   whole number or decimal number.
