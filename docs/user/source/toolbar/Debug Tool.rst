Conflicts
---------

The Current Project option will create a list of data conflicts. These
conflicts are not necessarily errors, they are generated based on the
conflict matrix. The conflict matrix is located Here:
c:\users\public\documents\FLO-2D Pro Documentation\Handouts\Conflict
Matrix.pdf

Levee Crests
------------

The final option is Levee Crest validation tool. It is used to review
the levees and grid element elevations.

Dialog Boxes
------------

The Errors and Warnings Dialog box shows all Errors, Conflicts, and
Warnings created by the file checking program. All of these boxes can be
used to sort and view and pan to cells with potential issues.

Debug Layers
------------

The layers show points where there are differences between channel bank
and floodplain bank elevations, rim and floodplain inlet elevations, and
depressed elements and levee crest elevations. In this example, the
layers are grouped using a QGIS standard layer grouping procedure.

Each layer has an attribute table that can be sorted and used to find
grid elements that may need elevation edits.
