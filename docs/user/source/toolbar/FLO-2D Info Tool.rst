Layers that work with this tool:

-  Channel layers

-  Left bank

-  Cross sections

-  Structure layers

-  Levee layers

-  Storm drain layers

Load the Data
-------------

1. Start by loading the channel
   surface elevation and peak discharge from the HYCHAN.OUT file.

4. Use the  
   Profile Tool widget to select the data plot source.

5. In this example, the  
   elevation raster is the y axis and the left bank length is the x axis.

6. Change the profile
   source from Raster to Schematic Layer and choose the water surface elevation.

7. In this example,
   the water surface elevation is the y axis.
