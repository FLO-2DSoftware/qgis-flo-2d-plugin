A plugin for pre-processing/post-processing FLO-2D models.

## Description

The FLO-2D Plugin for QGIS is a tool to develop, format, analyze, and display data used by the FLO-2D Flood Model. The Plugin can import project data, generate data and ex-port appropriately formatted FLO-2D data input files for a FLO-2D Project. The FLO-2D-Plugin reference manual, installed on your computer with the software, describes the assumptions, functions, and processes applied in the QGIS Plugin. A companion manual, the FLO-2D QGIS Plugin Userâ€™s Manual, describes the workflow, outlines the data structure and presents tutorials for the Plugin. It does not address the functionality and use of the FLO-2D model which has a separate set of reference manuals.
